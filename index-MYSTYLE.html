    <h1>My Top 5 Vacation Pics</h1>

    <h3>1. Davao City, Philippines</h3>
    <p>Is known to be one of the safest country in the world. As of June 2015, Davao City has a crime index of 18.18 and a safety index of 81.82. This month’s rating is a significant improvement from the city’s crime index of 19.31 and safety index of 80.69 from the previous survey.</p>

    <p>Samal Island is the most famous vacation destination for tourists. If you want to get away from the city and just dip your toes in the blue sea and sunbathe on the white sand, this is the perfect place for you. Only a 20-minute ride from the city, and you will be in paradise!</p>
    <p>There are a lot of activities to choose from: scuba diving, snorkeling, island-hopping, and many more. Located in the South of the Philippines, Davao is deemed one of the most beautiful, peaceful, and laid-back cities in the country. This is my hometown! In 2007 and 2014, my family and I are able to come visit and see my family!</p>

    <h3>2. New York</h3>
    <img src="https://image.newyork.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Freedom-Tower-One-World-Trade-Center-1.jpg" class="align-right slide-in">
    <p>One World Trade Center (also known as One World Trade, One WTC, or Freedom Tower)[note 1] is the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City. One WTC is the tallest building in the United States, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, and the sixth-tallest in the world. The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center. <br><br> The building is bounded by West Street to the west, Vesey Street to the north, Fulton Street to the south, and Washington Street to the east. The building's architect is David Childs, whose firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) also designed the Burj Khalifa and the Willis Tower. The construction of below-ground utility relocations, footings, and foundations for the new building began on April 27, 2006. One World Trade Center became the tallest structure in New York City on April 30, 2012, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building. The tower's steel structure was topped out on August 30, 2012. On May 10, 2013, the final component of the skyscraper's spire was installed, making the building, including its spire, reach a total height of 1,776 feet (541 m). Its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the United States Declaration of Independence was signed. The building opened on November 3, 2014;[14] the One World Observatory opened on May 29, 2015.[15] </p>
    <p>In 2016, we went to New York and stayed for 2 weeks! The experience was spectacular especially when we visit the One World Trade Center that was a great experience ever! Had lunch at China Town, walk at the Little Italy, see the MET and the Museum of Natural History, went to the Park and we also visited the JW World Headquarters with the group of friends. Cannot wait to go back there again someday!</p>

    <h3>3. San Francisco, CA</h3>

    <p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. It was initially designed by engineer Joseph Strauss in 1917. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[7]</p>
    <p>The Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as "possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world."[8][9] At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 4,200 feet (1,280 m) and a total height of 746 feet (227 m)</p>
    <p>In 2017, we visited San Francisco the second time for my Philippine Passport Renewal! Our last visit was 2011, its one of our favorite destination also! Of course, since we are in San Francisco for my Passport Renewal, we can stay for a week to see nice places in San Francisco, that includes, the golden gate bridge, palace of fine arts, we had a quick stop at Lumbard street, Lucas film, ocean side, Ghirardelli and painted ladies. We went to see the Muir woods and Golden Gate Bridge! that was really nice! After a week, we headed out to Monterey Bay for Whale Watching and stayed for another week! Love all the experience and the food!  </p>

    <h3>4. Monterey Bay, CA</h3>
    <img src="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2019/10/Monterey-Bay-920x609.png" class="align-right slide-in">

    <p>Monterey Bay is a bay of the Pacific Ocean located on the coast of the U.S. state of California. The bay is south of the major cities of San Francisco and San Jose. Santa Cruz is located at the north end of the bay, and Monterey is on the Monterey Peninsula at the south end. The "Monterey Bay Area" is a local colloquialism sometimes used to describe the whole of the Central Coast communities of Santa Cruz and Monterey counties.</p>
    <p>Monterey County is about to jump to the top of your list of picturesque regions to visit in the USA. This temperate central California beauty – made up of 12 cities including the cities of Monterey, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Pebble Beach and Big Sur – is full of lush, dramatic scenery. Picture seaside cliffs and pristine beaches, where you might spot whales, sea otters and migrating birds. From famous writers’ haunts to Spanish Missions, the history here is just as fascinating as the geography. Aside from the epic scenery, you'll savor unforgettable flavors from the area's award-winning food and wine scene. Plus, there are limitless opportunities for recreation, including world-class golf, shopping, kayaking, hiking and much more.</p>
    <p>Our favorite place to visit in Monterey is the Monterey, Aquarium. Kids favorite! We also love the food and the beach, seeing seals on the shore and of course we went to see Whale Watching! </p>

    <h3>5. Florida</h3>
    <img src="https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Walt-Disney-World-e1594920709667.jpg?w=600" class="align-left slide-in">

    <p>The Walt Disney World Resort, also called Walt Disney World and Disney World, is an entertainment resort complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida, in the United States, near the cities of Orlando and Kissimmee. Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was first operated by Walt Disney World Company. The property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39 sq mi; 101 km2), of which half has been used.[3] The resort comprises four theme parks (consisting of Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom), two water parks, 27 themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center Disney Springs.</p>
    <p>This is one of our favorite destination! In 2018, we took a 3-week trip to Florida! 5 days in Disney World, 2 days in St. Augustine, 3 days in Key Largo, 2 days in Key West, 3 days in Captiva Island, 3 days at Clearwater Beach. It took us 3 days drive to get from Colorado to Orlando, Florida. That is our longest vacation ever! 3 weeks full of fun and excitement! and we had the best family vacation ever! </p>
